# Privacy Policy

## What information is collected
The author of this project cares very much about your privacy, and for this very reason __does not incorporate any analytics into this extension__.

Further more, __no browsing history or personal information leaves the extension or is collected by its author__. _This excludes information that Google may collect automatically and/or which is outside the control of the author, such as installation/uninstallation statistics._

## Required permissions
The author realizes that some users may have concerns about this extension requiring the "read and change all data on all websites you visit" permission; however, it is crucial to note that this is a technical limitation of Google Chrome; without this permission, this extension would not be allowed to monitor tab title changes, and in turn, would not be able to do anything useful. In other words, this extension requires the "read and change all data on all websites you visit" permission because _more granular permissions like "read tab titles" and "change tab icons" **do not exist**_.

Being free and open source software, you are welcome, and even encouraged, to __read through the source code to verify this privacy policy__.

## Contact
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please visit this extension's Github repository at https://github.com/willg101/blue-dot-replacement to open an issue or send the author a private message.
